Melany for Wordpress
====================

Melany is a simple, minimal and responsive WordPress Theme aimed at bringing a pure Twitter Bootstrap experience in WordPress blogs.
It is addressed to privates and small businesses that need to focus users attention in the content, but allows deep customizations.

Based on _s
-----------

There's plenty of starter themes on the Internet, but they're mostly parent themes: not very cool to use and distribute the derivative work. Thanks God, I found this toolbox by ThemeShaper, _s, and I must say that's great!


Designed with Twitter Bootstrap
-------------------------------

Twitter Bootstrap is a powerful framework that allows a faster and easier web development. That's not only its description, it's reality. Because it's very powerful, I decided to use it for this project.


The content, everywhere
-----------------------

I don't like that kind of layout that highlights the look instead of the content, at least on blogs. Melany is meant to be clear, linear, and make people enjoy the contents, everywhere, from the desktop to the smarphone.
